## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate programmer with a strong desire to learn, a good work ethic, and perseverance. After writing my first project in C++, Iâ€™ve realized that programming is my passion. I've since cultivated a robust skill set in modern web development, excelling in frontend technologies like ReactJS (including Redux Toolkit for state management and RTK Query for efficient data fetching), Next.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI. On the backend, I'm proficient with Express.js, enabling me to build comprehensive full-stack solutions. Furthermore, my research background and skills for quantitative data analysis allow me to approach complex problems with a data-driven perspective.
