## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate programmer with a strong desire to learn, a good work ethic, and perseverance. After writing my first project in C++, Iâ€™ve realized that programming is my passion. 

I've since cultivated a robust skill set in modern web development, excelling in frontend technologies like **ReactJS (including Redux Toolkit for state management and RTK Query for efficient data fetching), Next.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI**. For the backend, I'm proficient with **Express.js and Mongoose.js using MongoDB**, enabling me to build comprehensive full-stack solutions. 

Furthermore, my research background and skills for quantitative data analysis allow me to approach complex problems with a data-driven perspective.
